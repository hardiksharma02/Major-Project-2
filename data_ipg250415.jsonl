The system requires no computer-aided control or timing, nor is any external power source needed, other than the force exerted as a container is inserted into the restraint. The system relies upon an assembly including mechanically-biased pivoting levers, each of which has a horizontal element and a vertical element. All actuation occurs as the base of an inserted container comes into contact with the upper surface of the horizontal elements of multiple pivoted levers positioned at the base of a channel adapted to serve as a guide for the inserted tube. The levers are biased in this elevated position by mechanical means, such as a spring. As the inserted tube presses the horizontal members downward, the top portions of the vertical members are pivoted inward toward the container's exterior. Friction pads situated upon the interior surface of each vertical element are brought into contact with the exterior of the container, thereby gripping it. This gripping action holds the container with sufficient friction to permit the removal or attachment of a screw cap. Further embodiments of the invention include a mechanically biased platform supporting the channel and the pivoting levers. This base is biased and positioned to permit the channel and the pivoting lever assembly to be translated downward against the force biasing the platform and translate through the body of the container restraint.
